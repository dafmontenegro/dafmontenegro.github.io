**Zima Blue** is, at its core, *the search for the self*, leaving the door open for some questions: **Is the search for the self cyclical? Is life itself also cyclical?**  

After his journey through the cosmos, **Zima** returns to the place where it all began. In an *almost prophetic act*, **Zima Blue** transforms into his original form, undergoing a metamorphosis into his *simplest self*: **Was what he searched for always there?** If so, **then why did he leave?**  

It is quite paradoxical to ask that, because *everything Zima did along his journey brought him closer and closer to that very end; which was, in essence, the same as his beginning.* That is why this *search for the self* can be understood as something *cyclical*, or at the very least, **a return to the essential**.

We are beings *always lacking something, intrinsically incomplete*; one of our greatest needs is **time**. Every step we take is actually *one less*. However, what makes existence magnificent is that, even knowing it is destined to end, **it still chooses to happen**, and it happens with such force that *it gives meaning to all its purposes*.  

Not every ending necessarily implies destruction or leads to nothingness; **Zima Blue** *courageously threw himself into the vastness of creation only to return to simplicity and allow himself to appreciate it.* Sometimes, **true satisfaction is not found in the complexity of answers, but in the authenticity of a well-asked simple question**: **Who am I?**
